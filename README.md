# 🎨 BlockParty2D - Color Hunt Game 🎮

## 🚀 Project Description
Is this a **color blindness test**? 🤔 Nope! It's a fun and simple **pixel-art game** where you must move to a **randomly selected color** in an image.  
Inspired by the popular Minecraft minigame **"BlockParty"**, this game lets you **expand your experience** by adding any image to the `Resources/Images/Game Images` folder — no special formatting required! 🖼️✨

## 🌟 Features

While still a simple game, it packs these cool features:

1. 🎨 **Extendability**  
   Add your own images to `Resources/Images/Game Images` — the game auto-loads them with zero hassle!  
   
2. 📊 **Game Stats**  
   Track your **high score**, **games played**, and **rounds completed** right from the "Stats" menu.  
   
3. 🎲 **Randomized Game Over Messages**  
   Spice up your game over screen! Customize the messages in `screens/GameOver.py` at line 13.
